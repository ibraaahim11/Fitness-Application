<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## <a id="about-the-project"></a>About The Project

Are you a fitness enthusiast looking for more than just a calorie tracker? This Fitness Application is built for people who want to take control of their health, connect with expert coaches for truly personalized plans, and discover exciting fitness events and places‚Äîall in one platform. I realized that most people need an app to track their calories and eating habits, a platform to connect with coaches for personalized plans, and a social space to discover cool fitness places (academies). This project combines all those essential tools and technologies into a single, seamless experience to motivate, connect, and empower users on every step of their fitness journey.



## Database Diagrams

The entity-relationship & relational-schema diagrams for this project are quite intricate and comprehensive, reflecting the many features and relationships in the system. They are worth looking at if you would like to understand the system more as I am pretty proud of them.
